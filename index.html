            to the zoo by a Canadian regiment who were called up to fight in France during the First World War.
            Winnie lived at ZSL London Zoo from 1914 until 1934 during which author AA Milne brought his son,

            London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly
            because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are
            constructed from Portland stone.</p>
